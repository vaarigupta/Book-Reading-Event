In fact, the only thing bigger than your TBR pile is your bookish buckets list, which includes author-inspired vacations, Harry Potter-themed sight seeing, and these literary events every book-lover wants to go to.

                You can attend real-life events where a lot of people think of readers as solitary people who prefer to stay in the house alone with a good book than go out into the real world and interact.
                While it may be true that most of the time bibliophiles do prefer a Friday night in with a thriller and a bottle of wine rather than human interaction and putting pants on, we also appreciate any kind of gathering that involves books, authors, and other literary-lovers.
                There's no limit to our love for books.
